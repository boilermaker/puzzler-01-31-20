> What is the minimum value of ɸ that will allow your bowl to split your opponents’ bowls without hitting them?

1. The balls have a radius of 1.
2. The center of the red balls is separate by a distance 5.

The closest that it could come without hitting the balls would form a right triangle, where 2.5 is the hypotenuse, and 2 is the opposite -- as indicated in the diagram below, (not drawn to scale).

From that we get:

```
   sin ɸ = 2/2.5
       ɸ = 53.1
```
